I am a Berlin-based software engineer and engineering leader.

My passion is in building and improving processes that enable teams to move faster, better, and happier.

I enjoy learning about Functional Programming and applying it to real problems. Functional programming is simple enough to allow me to focus on the business logic instead of keeping track of intricate dependencies and state mutations.

That said, I believe there is no better tool for quickly iterating a new web project than Ruby on Rails, which Iâ€™ve been using on and off for years.

Occasionally, I blog at [nywkap.com](http://nywkap.com).
